Collaborative Filtering Recommender System
Introduction
Welcome to the Collaborative Filtering Recommender System project! This repository contains a practical implementation of a recommender system using the collaborative filtering learning algorithm. Our focus is on recommending movies based on user ratings, applying concepts that can easily be adapted to other recommendation needs. The goal is to match users with movies they're likely to enjoy, based on their past preferences.

Overview
Collaborative filtering works by predicting a user's interest in a product (in this case, movies) based on ratings or preferences of many users. The algorithm identifies patterns in user ratings to recommend movies to a user who has not seen them. This project utilizes a dataset derived from the MovieLens "ml-latest-small" dataset, focusing on movies from the year 2000 onwards.

Features
Notation System: The algorithm employs a specific notation to represent users, movies, and their ratings efficiently.
Algorithm Implementation: We implement the collaborative filtering algorithm to predict how users might rate movies they haven't yet watched.
Data Normalization: Ratings are normalized to adjust for users who rate more harshly or more leniently than average.
Learning Movie Recommendations: The system is trained with existing user ratings, improving its accuracy in predicting future ratings.
Customizable User Ratings: Users can input their own movie ratings to receive personalized recommendations.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.6+
TensorFlow 2.x
NumPy
Pandas (for data manipulation and analysis)
Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies:
Copy code
pip install numpy tensorflow pandas
Usage
Load the Data: Start by loading the movie dataset, which contains user ratings for various movies.
Customize Your Ratings: Input your ratings for any movies you've already seen. This will be used as the basis for your recommendations.
Train the Model: Execute the collaborative filtering algorithm to learn from the dataset.
Get Recommendations: Once the model is trained, you can see which movies the system recommends based on your input.
Data Structure
The project utilizes several key matrices to represent the data:

Ratings Matrix (Y): Contains the ratings users have given to movies.
User Preferences Matrix (X): Represents the feature ratings for movies.
User Features Matrix (W): Contains the parameters for each user, reflecting their preferences.
Code Structure
cofi_cost_func: Computes the cost function for collaborative filtering.
Custom training loop using TensorFlow to learn the model parameters.
Functions to load the dataset and normalize the ratings.
Customizing Your Recommendations
To customize the recommendations, edit the my_ratings variable in the script by assigning ratings to movie IDs as shown in the comments. This personalization allows the system to tailor its recommendations to your tastes.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates the power of collaborative filtering in building a movie recommendation system. By analyzing patterns in user ratings, it can predict user preferences for unrated movies, making personalized recommendations. Feel free to adapt the code and concepts to other types of recommendation systems.
