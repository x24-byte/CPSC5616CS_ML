Introduction to K-means Clustering

Learn about the K-means algorithm: an iterative process that groups data into clusters based on similarity.
Implementing K-means

Finding Closest Centroids: Understand how to assign data points to the nearest cluster centroid.
Computing Centroid Means: Learn to recalculate centroids based on the assigned data points.
Applying K-means on a Sample Dataset

Visualize how K-means iteratively refines cluster assignments to minimize variance within clusters.
Random Initialization

Explore the significance of random initialization in the performance and outcome of the K-means algorithm.
Image Compression with K-means

Exercises
The notebook is structured around key exercises that allow you to implement and test components of the K-means algorithm:

Exercise 1: Implement the function to find the closest centroids.
Exercise 2: Implement the function to compute new centroid means based on current cluster assignments.
These exercises are designed to solidify your understanding of the algorithm's mechanics by applying it to synthetic data and a real-world application: compressing an image by reducing its color space.

Visualizations
Throughout the notebook, we include visual aids to help you grasp the concepts and observe the algorithm's progress. These include:

2D plots showing the distribution of data and the movement of centroids.
The original and compressed images, illustrating the practical impact of K-means clustering on image compression.
Conclusion and Further Exploration
By completing this notebook, you'll understand the basics of K-means clustering and its application. You're encouraged to experiment further by adjusting parameters, such as the number of clusters and iterations, and observing the outcomes.

For those interested in diving deeper, consider exploring different initialization strategies or applying K-means to other types of data. The versatility of K-means makes it a valuable tool for a wide range of applications in data analysis and machine learning.
